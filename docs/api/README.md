# API docs

Phase 1 endpoints are real and tested (see `backend/tests/`). Everything
else is still unimplemented — see `ROADMAP.md` for phase order. Keep this
file in sync with `backend/src/modules/*/routes` (AGENTS.md doc-update
rule).

Base URL: `http://localhost:4000` locally (`PORT` in `.env`). No OpenAPI
spec yet — TBD, tracked informally, not blocking Phase 1.

## Auth (`/auth`) — `backend/src/modules/auth`

| Method & path | Auth | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/signup` | none | `{ role: 'patient'\|'doctor', email, password, fullName }` | **`role` is restricted to `patient`/`doctor` server-side, not just in docforum-web's UI** — facility accounts are admin-invited only (PRD OQ-2). Returns `{ user, accessToken }`; sets an httpOnly refresh cookie. |
| `POST /auth/login` | none | `{ email, password }` | Same response shape as signup. **Throttled** (Phase 8, issue #35) — see below. |
| `POST /auth/refresh` | refresh cookie + `X-CSRF-Token` | — | Reads the httpOnly cookie (not the body). Returns a fresh `{ user, accessToken, csrfToken }` and rotates the cookie **and** the CSRF token. `403` if the CSRF token is missing/wrong or the `Origin` isn't allowlisted. |
| `POST /auth/logout` | `X-CSRF-Token` | — | Clears the refresh cookie. `204 No Content`; `403` without the CSRF header or from a disallowed `Origin`. |
| `POST /auth/verify-email` | none | `{ token }` | Redeems the token from the verification email. `200 { emailVerifiedAt }`. Errors are `400` with `code: 'INVALID_VERIFICATION_TOKEN'` (unknown / already used) or `code: 'VERIFICATION_TOKEN_EXPIRED'`. Single-use and atomic — two concurrent redemptions can't both succeed. |
| `POST /auth/verify-email/resend` | access token | — | Re-sends to the caller's own address. `200 { resendAfterSeconds }`. `409 EMAIL_ALREADY_VERIFIED` if already verified; `429 EMAIL_VERIFICATION_RATE_LIMITED` if a mail went out less than `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_RESEND_INTERVAL_SECONDS` ago (default 60). Authenticated and account-scoped on purpose — no email in the body, so it can't be used to enumerate accounts. |

### Email verification (Phase 8, issue #34)

`POST /auth/signup` creates the account **unverified** (`user.emailVerifiedAt`
is `null` in the response and in `GET`-style payloads). Unverified accounts
can log in, refresh, and browse; they get
`403 { message, code: 'EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED' }` from mutating routes that
depend on a trustworthy contact address:

- `POST /appointments` (booking)
- `POST /payments/wallet-link`, `POST /payments/intents`,
  `POST /payments/intents/:id/{fund,release,refund}`

That guard reads the database rather than trusting a claim in the access
token, so verifying in one tab unblocks the caller immediately instead of
after the 15-minute token TTL.

**No email provider is integrated yet** (Phase 6, issue #17) —
`backend/src/modules/auth/services/email-dispatcher.ts` is the
provider-agnostic seam and currently drops the message (logging only the
subject and recipient, never the body/token). On a hosted deployment, an
operator can mark an address verified out-of-band with
`node backend/scripts/mark-email-verified.mjs <email>`; see
`scripts/README.md`. This is a documented interim, not the end state.

Env knobs: `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES` (default 1440),
`EMAIL_VERIFICATION_RESEND_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 60),
`EMAIL_VERIFICATION_LANDING_URL` (where the emailed link points).

### CSRF (Phase 8, issue #37)

The refresh cookie is `SameSite=None; Secure` in production (docforum-web on
GitHub Pages and this API on Render are different sites), so **any** website
can cause a browser to send it to `/auth/refresh` / `/auth/logout`. Those two
routes are therefore protected by:

1. **A required `X-CSRF-Token` header** carrying the `csrfToken` from the
   login/signup/refresh response body. It's a claim inside the refresh JWT
   for that session, so it rotates together with the cookie and needs no
   server-side state. On `/auth/logout` there is no session token to match
   against, so the header's presence is required instead (the impact of a
   forged logout is a forced sign-out, not data loss).
2. **An `Origin` allowlist** — a request whose `Origin` is present and not on
   the CORS allowlist is rejected with `403 Origin not allowed.`
3. **An explicit per-environment CORS allowlist** — `CORS_ORIGINS`
   (comma-separated; `CORS_ORIGIN` still works as a single origin).
   Production defaults to `https://docforum.github.io`; local dev to
   `http://localhost:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

**Why not a double-submit cookie** (the usual default): a cookie set by this
API is a third-party cookie to `docforum.github.io`, so docforum-web's
JavaScript can never read it — the value therefore has to travel in the
response body instead. See `backend/src/middleware/csrf.ts`.

**Client requirements (docforum-web):**

- Store `csrfToken` from the signup/login/refresh response next to the access
  token (in memory), and replace it on every refresh response.
- Send it on the two cookie-authenticated calls:
  `fetch(url, { method: 'POST', credentials: 'include', headers: { 'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken } })`.
- A `403` there means re-login, not retry.

**Requests with no `Origin` header** (curl, server-to-server): allowed past
the Origin check, but the CSRF header is still required — an attacker's page
can't win by suppressing `Origin`. Sessions issued before this change carry
no `csrf` claim in their refresh token, so they are rejected with `403` and
need one re-login.

### Login throttling (Phase 8, issue #35)

`POST /auth/login` is rate-limited **per normalised email and per client
IP**, with state in Postgres (so it survives restarts and doesn't assume a
single instance). Bucket size is capped by the first limit reached:

| Phase | Response |
|---|---|
| Below `LOGIN_THROTTLE_BACKOFF_AFTER` failures (default 3) in the window | normal `401 { message: 'Invalid email or password.' }` |
| At/after it | `429` with a `Retry-After: <seconds>` header, growing exponentially (`LOGIN_THROTTLE_BACKOFF_BASE_SECONDS` × 2ⁿ, capped at `LOGIN_THROTTLE_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS`) |
| At `LOGIN_THROTTLE_LOCK_AFTER` failures (default 10) | `429` locked for `LOGIN_THROTTLE_LOCK_SECONDS` (default 15 min). The lock is set once per window and is not extended by further attempts |
| Window (`LOGIN_THROTTLE_WINDOW_SECONDS`, default 15 min) | New window restarts the count at 1 and clears the lock |

A successful login clears the **per-account** counter. The per-IP bucket is
left alone, so one valid login can't reset a shared-IP budget.

Clients should honour `Retry-After` and must **not** treat a `429` as
"account locked permanently". The response is identical for a real and a
non-existent address, and for a locked and a backing-off bucket — it
deliberately reveals nothing about whether the account exists (an absent
account also pays bcrypt's comparison cost, so timing doesn't leak either).

`POST /auth/login-attempts/clear` (admin-only) clears a lock a legitimate
user is stuck behind: body `{ email?, ip? }` (at least one), returns
`{ cleared }`. Clear **both** when a lock was taken out via the account's IP,
or the IP bucket will keep refusing them. It's logged to the server console
— there is no `AuditEvent` table yet (known gap), so that's the interim
record.

Under the hood this uses Express's `trust proxy` setting via the
`TRUST_PROXY` env var: `1` behind Render's single proxy hop, `false` (the
default) locally. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 — the wrong value is a security
bug in either direction. A cleanup interval in `src/server.ts` prunes
buckets whose last failure is older than
`LOGIN_THROTTLE_PRUNE_AFTER_SECONDS` (default 24 h).

Access tokens: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, 15-minute TTL, no
revocation list yet (see `ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md` known gaps —
JWT refresh rotation without a revocation list). Refresh tokens: httpOnly
cookie, 30-day TTL, `SameSite=None; Secure` in production and
`Lax`/insecure locally — the attributes live in `config.cookie`
(`backend/src/config/index.ts`) so the refresh and CSRF cookies can never
drift apart. See `docs/adr/0003` for why production needs `SameSite=None`.

## Doctors (`/doctors`) — `backend/src/modules/doctors`

| Method & path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /doctors/me` | doctor | Returns the caller's own `DoctorProfile`. |
| `PATCH /doctors/:doctorProfileId/verification` | admin | Body `{ status: 'pending'\|'verified'\|'rejected' }`. Manual, admin-gated per PRD FR-3 — there is no automated verification pipeline. |

## Availability (`/availability`) — `backend/src/modules/availability`

| Method & path | Auth | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /availability/doctors/:doctorProfileId/slots` | none | — | Lists that doctor's open, future slots. Public on purpose — a patient needs to see availability before signing in. |
| `POST /availability/doctors/:doctorProfileId/slots/generate` | doctor (self only) | `{ date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', startHour, endHour, slotLengthMinutes }` | Fixed-length, single-day generation — no recurrence engine (ARCHITECTURE.md §6.3.6 guardrail). Idempotent: re-running with an overlapping range skips slots that already exist rather than erroring or duplicating. |

## Appointments (`/appointments`) — `backend/src/modules/appointments`

| Method & path | Auth | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /appointments` | patient | `{ availabilitySlotId }` | **The concurrency-critical endpoint** — see `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.1 and `backend/tests/integration/booking.test.mts`. `409` if the slot is no longer open. |
| `GET /appointments/mine` | patient | — | Caller's own appointments, most recent first. |

## Facilities (`/facilities`) — `backend/src/modules/facilities`

| Method & path | Auth | Query | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /facilities/eligible` | any signed-in user | `capabilityType?` (`lab_test`\|`medication_dispense`), `detail?`, `near=lat,lng`, `radiusKm?`, `limit?` (1–200, default 50) | PRD FR-13 / Phase 5 issue #74. Qualified facilities, optionally sorted ascending by distance from `near` (haversine, default radius 50 km when `near` is given without `radiusKm`). Facilities without coordinates are **never dropped** — they appear with `distanceKm: null`, sorted last. `radiusKm` without `near` → 400. **The patient's `near` point is never stored or logged** — it is only ever a query parameter in the SQL statement. Response rows: `{ id, name, type, address, distanceKm }`. Auth required because a location query is patient context; no role gate (the point itself isn't persisted anywhere it could leak from). |

## Pharmacy orders (`/pharmacy-orders`) — `backend/src/modules/pharmacy-orders`

Item-level (partial) fulfillment — Phase 5 issue #73, see
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.3.

| Method & path | Auth | Body | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /pharmacy-orders/fulfillments` | patient or admin (verified email) | `{ orderType, orderId, facilityId, orderItemIds? }` | Routes items to a facility: one `FulfillmentRecord` + one `FulfillmentItem` per item. Omit `orderItemIds` to route every item; pass only the remaining items to split a partially dispensed order across a second facility. `409` if any requested item was already dispensed elsewhere, `400` if an item doesn't belong to the order. |
| `GET /pharmacy-orders/fulfillments/:id` | owning facility or admin | — | Record + item rows. Patients are excluded until Phase 4 links `PatientProfile` to orders (known gap, `ARCHITECTURE.md` §6.2). |
| `PATCH /pharmacy-orders/fulfillments/:id` | owning facility (verified email) | `{ status: 'in_progress'\|'rejected' }` | `fulfilled` is **not settable** — it is derived from the record's dispensed items. Hard rule 5: a facility may only ever write records it owns (`403` otherwise). |
| `PATCH /pharmacy-orders/fulfillments/:id/items/:itemId` | owning facility (verified email) | `{ status: 'dispensed'\|'unfulfilled', quantityDispensed? }` | The only path to `dispensed`. One-shot (`409` on replay) and race-safe: the `(orderType, dispensedKey)` unique index makes a second facility's dispense of the same item a `409`, even under concurrency (`backend/tests/integration/fulfillment.test.mts`). After each item change the record status and the order-level status are re-derived. |
| `GET /pharmacy-orders/orders/:orderId/fulfillment-status?orderType=` | any signed-in user | — | Derived order state: `{ totalItems, dispensedItems, status: 'issued'\|'partially_fulfilled'\|'fulfilled' }`. Computed from item rows — never a hand-set flag. |

Payment release rule (documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.3): partial
fulfillment never releases escrow — release eligibility requires the
order to derive `fulfilled`. Release itself is still admin-triggered
(ADR 0004 v1).

## Not yet implemented

Everything else in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §3's module list (`patients`,
`consultations`, `referrals`, `prescriptions`, `lab-orders`,
`payments`, `notifications`) has no routes yet — Phase
2 onward, see `ROADMAP.md`.
