# jobs

Background jobs (reminders, order-expiry checks, notification delivery).

Per ARCHITECTURE_ESSENTIALS.md: keep this simple (cron/interval) until a
real job exists — do not introduce a queue (e.g. BullMQ/Redis) preemptively.
See ARCHITECTURE.md §6.3.2 for the overengineering flag on this exact point.

No jobs implemented yet. See ROADMAP.md.
